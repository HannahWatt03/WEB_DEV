## About This Project

This repository contains all of my assignments completed for the CMPT 353 course at the University of Saskatchewan. It highlights my competencies in both frontend and backend development, demonstrating my ability to build full-stack applications using modern technologies.

## Frontend Development

The frontend components of these assignments showcase my skills in developing responsive and user-friendly interfaces. Technologies such as HTML5 and React were used to build RESTful interfaces that provide seamless user interaction and efficient communication with backend services.

## Backend Development

On the backend, these assignments demonstrate my experience working with databases and server-side technologies. I utilized tools such as CouchDB and MySQL to design, implement, and manage data-driven applications, ensuring robust performance and scalability
